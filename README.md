# Hi, I'm Tom Harvey!

I'm an astrophysics PhD student at the University of Manchester. I research high-redshift galaxies using telescopes like JWST and HST. My PhD research has focused on finding and charicterizing the stellar properties of galaxies and their statistical distributions at z > 6 with JWST. I'm generally interested in SED fitting, Bayesian techniques and using ML to accelerate traditional approaches for large samples.
